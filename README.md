# hello-world
Just a beginner's repository🤷🏽‍♂️

I'm a former athlete who's life-long dream of playing professional football was left unrealized.
However, I don't believe in the concept of "failure" within our lives (despite how bugs in your code might make you feel).
We either succeed, or we learn; we never lose. 

I now move forward in my life focussing on my increased interest for computer software in hopes it can lead me to new goals and dreams to pursue passionatley. 

Here's to a lifetime of learning and to the willingness of being a total n00b in order to eventually get to where you want to be.
